Software: HDS
Interface: comma.ai white panda or other suitable VCI like a tactrix

Reflector: any metal should do. The oem part looks to be welded aluminum with a plastic nut to secure the target to the clamp, with a threaded rod on the other end. It seems that they're unavailable, thus this repo. I don't have one.

Stand: PVC. Probably 2" ID

Prereqs: Draw the car's "box".

Begin the alignment process in HDS in an open space without the radar target in place. When HDS prompts you, align and place the target.

Align the mount to the bottom of the radar unit, then raise the target 22mm upward. Next, place the target 4 meters forward of the centerline of the front wheels and also directly inline with the radar.

Offsets:
- Civic Hatch: 22.95inches (0.58 meters) from center
- Insight: ?
- Center mounted (Accord, CRV): Center on vehicle center line

Continue in software until the computer shows you the alignment offset. Adjust until satisfied and complete the alignment process.

What if the target doesn't work?: Idk. Go buy a real one if you can. All of this info is free and untested.
