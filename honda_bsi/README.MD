Degrees of offset from the car's sideline: 20 degrees.
Vertical alignment: near 0 degrees
Horizontal alignment: Honda has a target that can be used. Seems to be about 12" wide.

Alignment process: It's really a checking procedure. Using a laser on the radar's plastic casting dimple, if the laser beam falls outside of the target at 20 degrees, check body or radar mount for damage. If you're poor, shim the mount until it's in spec.

Todo: Show the damn target
