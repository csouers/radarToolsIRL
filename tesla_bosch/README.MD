Prereqs: Park the vehicle on level ground.

Vertical alignment: Apply bubble level to top of radar unit. This spot of the unit should be level to the ground.
Horizontal alignment: Factory instructions say to start a drive cycle calibration. I suspect this is really the radar's Vertical and Horizontal misalignment signals as seen in the radar's TeslaRadarSguInfo frame (0x301). After a test drive, it's exposed as degrees of adjustment needed in Tesla's Toolbox. We might be able to use this without Toolbox.

Warranties: Absolutely none.
